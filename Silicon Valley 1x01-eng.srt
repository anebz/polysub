3
00:00:18,823 --> 00:00:21,833
Somebody make some fucking noise here.

4
00:00:25,163 --> 00:00:26,748
Fuck these people.

5
00:00:30,785 --> 00:00:33,571
This place is amazing.

6
00:00:33,621 --> 00:00:35,206
Damn Goolybib.

7
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:36,958
These guys created a mediocre program...

8
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:40,542
...that maybe one day they'll be worth something and now they live here.

9
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:42,346
There's a lot of money all over Silicon Valley...

10
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:44,883
...but not a penny falls to us.

11
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:46,575
What the hell are you eating?

12
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:49,186
Liquid shrimp. 200 bucks a liter.

13
00:00:49,237 --> 00:00:50,972
Wylie Dufresne did it.

14
00:00:51,322 --> 00:00:53,024
What does it taste like?

15
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:55,677
Which I've always imagined tastes like semen.

16
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:58,647
They're taking it all in?

17
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:00,864
Because this is what happens when...

18
00:01:00,915 --> 00:01:04,284
Google buys your company for over $200 million.

19
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:06,405
Look, Dustin Moskovitz.

20
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:08,839
Elon Musk, Eric Schmidt.

21
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,609
That moron whatever his name was who created Photrio.

22
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:14,713
Wow, Kid Rock is the poorest of them all here.

23
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:16,581
Besides you, of course.

24
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:20,900
There's $40 billion in net worth present at this party...

25
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:23,287
...and you're standing there, drinking liquid shrimp...

26
00:01:23,337 --> 00:01:25,340
...talking about the taste of semen.

27
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,810
You live in my incubator.

28
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,395
You have to relate, that's why I brought you here.

29
00:01:31,446 --> 00:01:33,014
I had us invited.

30
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:35,566
Javeed, over there, was my roommate.

31
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:37,835
Yeah, but I drove.

32
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,743
Eric Schmidt, Erlich Bachman.

33
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,908
It's amazing how men and women at these events...

34
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,328
...they always split up like this.

35
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:50,219
Yeah, every party in Silicon Valley ends up like a jasid wedding.

36
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:52,867
Even Goolybibs don't talk to girls.

37
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:54,536
They don't need it, Cabezón.

38
00:01:54,586 --> 00:01:56,587
This house talks to the girls.

39
00:01:59,557 --> 00:02:00,791
What's up?

40
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,797
I have eight words for you: I love...

41
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:07,966
I have eight words for you: I love...

42
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:10,700
...multiplatform functionality...

43
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:12,770
...incorporated from Goolybib!

44
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:14,198
Yes!

45
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:18,994
But seriously...

46
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:22,946
Just a few days ago, when we met Barack Obama...

47
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:24,348
I told these guys...

48
00:02:24,398 --> 00:02:27,369
"Okay, we're making a fortune.

49
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:30,038
And, yes, affecting digital media.

50
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:32,824
But most importantly...

51
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:35,579
...is that we're improving the world.

52
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:38,179
By creating high-class hierarchies...

53
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:41,799
...for maximum re-use and code extensibility."

54
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,220
So, fellas...

55
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,333
For many nights more like this one.

56
00:02:49,107 --> 00:02:53,111
An ovation for my great friend, Kid Rock.

57
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:55,597
What a jerk.

58
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:05,379
Subtitles by aRGENTeaM www.argentam.net Cabezón, there are personal ads...

59
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:09,961
Subtitles by aRGENTeaM www.argentam.net Cabezón, there are personal ads...

60
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:12,030
...on this page of Asperger's disease.

61
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,831
Holy shit, one you're looking for...

62
00:03:13,882 --> 00:03:17,116
..."a relationship with potential to become something sexual."

63
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:19,070
Wow, he's in the spectrum.

64
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,539
He can't make eye contact or the camera.

65
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:23,258
Richard, can I talk to you?

66
00:03:23,308 --> 00:03:24,585
Alone.

67
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:31,132
We need to talk about the "Hamelin Flautist."

68
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:33,684
But for what? The website is working...

69
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:36,304
...I'm redesigning compression, it only needs users.

70
00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:38,355
Yeah, you don't say.

71
00:03:38,406 --> 00:03:40,141
Even assuming someone wanted to...

72
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:42,944
I couldn't figure out how to use it, it's incomprehensible.

73
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:45,413
Richard, when you proposed "The Flutist"...

74
00:03:45,463 --> 00:03:47,765
...you told me I was going to be the Google of music...

75
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:49,733
...which is a fantastic way to propose something.

76
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:52,120
I thought I'd have apps.

77
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,155
And he's got all that, when he gets popular...

78
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:56,624
...and it will be when it has a critical mass of users...

79
00:03:56,674 --> 00:03:58,743
..."The Piper of Hamelin" will be able to search the entire universe...

80
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:01,279
...of music to compare melodies and tell you...

81
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:03,380
...if you're violating the copyright of a piece.

82
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:05,083
So if you're a composer or a-- for starters, no one cares about stealing someone else's music, okay?

83
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:08,568
So if you're a composer or a-- for starters, no one cares about stealing someone else's music, okay?

84
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,721
Everyone involved in the music industry...

85
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:11,973
...they steal it or share it.

86
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:14,224
They're a bunch of bastards, especially Radiohead.

87
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:15,626
- Listen, Richard...

88
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:17,562
Yeah, they're bastards.

89
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:20,148
Now listen, Richard, if you want to live here...

90
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:21,466
...produces results.

91
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:25,186
I can't carry dead weight in my incubator, okay?

92
00:04:25,236 --> 00:04:27,605
Either you do that, or at least it proves to be fucking promising.

93
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:30,692
Like "NipAlert", the Cabezón app.

94
00:04:30,742 --> 00:04:33,410
It tells you the location of a woman with erect nipples.

95
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:34,912
That's what people want.

96
00:04:34,963 --> 00:04:37,166
Richard, you have to get in touch with humanity.

97
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:39,501
When I sold my company, Aviato...

98
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,153
That's why I founded this.

99
00:04:42,203 --> 00:04:44,956
To do something huge, to change things.

100
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:46,857
You know, like Steve.

101
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,630
Jobs or Wozniak?

102
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:52,964
Steve Jobs or Steve...

103
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:55,133
I did hear you.

104
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:57,519
- So, what-- - Jobs.

105
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,740
Well, Jobs was a fake, he didn't even write code.

106
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,943
You just went to hell.

107
00:05:05,994 --> 00:05:08,696
- Well, technically...

108
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:10,565
Bighead, I'm gonna be meditating.

109
00:05:10,615 --> 00:05:14,692
Jobs knew how to pack the ideas, but it was Wozniak who...

110
00:05:17,872 --> 00:05:20,691
<i>What is Hooli? Excellent question.</i>

111
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:23,460
<i>Hooli is not just another state-of-the-art technology company.</i>

112
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:25,330
<i>Hooli are not just programs.</i>

113
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,917
<i>Hooli... consists of people.</i>

114
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:31,718
<i>Hooli consists of innovative technology...</i>

115
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,553
<i>...which makes a difference...</i>

116
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:35,673
<i>...transforming the world we know...</i>

117
00:05:35,723 --> 00:05:38,876
<i>...making it a better world...</i>

118
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:40,878
<i>...through minimal message transport layers.</i>

119
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:44,481
<i>I am convinced that we will only achieve greatness...</i>

120
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:48,027
<i>...if we first achieve goodness.</i>

121
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:52,240
Erlich will throw me out.

122
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,108
And I can't pay a rent here.

123
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:56,660
It's crazy. $2,800 a month...

124
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:59,063
$4,500 a month with five people.

125
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:01,532
Jesus, why is it so expensive to live here?

126
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:06,003
Look what a dump this place is.

127
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:08,256
There's another one.

128
00:06:08,306 --> 00:06:12,357
A Mrs. Palo Alto 2013. Here she goes.

129
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:19,300
For God's sake, the marketing team made another bike meeting.

130
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,219
You morons.

131
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:24,788
Another day inside Gavin Belson's facility.

132
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:28,109
Did you hear what Peter Gregory is doing?

133
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:30,027
You mean buy that island in the Pacific?

134
00:06:30,077 --> 00:06:33,130
No, he's building one, in fact, he's a beast.

135
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:35,284
Anyway, he's also offering $100,000...

136
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:37,150
...to anyone who doesn't sign up or desert from college...

137
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:38,602
...to pursue an idea.

138
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:42,088
I don't know what happened to him, but he hates universities.

139
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:45,208
And he's giving a TED TALKS lecture in Palo Alto tonight.

140
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:47,629
- I dropped out of college.

141
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:49,747
Maybe I should re-register and desert again...

142
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:51,341
See if he'll give me the money.

143
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:56,021
A CHANGE IS REQUIRED TO MAKE A "Programmone" CHANGE.

144
00:06:57,671 --> 00:06:58,806
A CHANGE IS REQUIRED TO MAKE A "Programmone" CHANGE.

145
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:01,259
Why them?

146
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:03,344
A double macchiato for me.

147
00:07:03,394 --> 00:07:05,980
Yeah.

148
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,766
Hey, buddy, are you going to the gym?

149
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:10,935
No, no, I'm not going.

150
00:07:10,985 --> 00:07:12,820
I don't have time, even if I wanted to go.

151
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,571
I'm very busy with my website.

152
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:17,325
I don't want to end up being a Hooli fossil...

153
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,477
...to work here for eternity.

154
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:23,698
Yeah, working for the world's most innovative company...

155
00:07:23,748 --> 00:07:26,984
...with great pay and options to acquire shares.

156
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:28,670
I understand perfectly well that you don't want that.

157
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,489
You're like an artist, an entrepreneur.

158
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:35,043
An iconoclast.

159
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:37,011
I don't know.

160
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:39,213
Hey, we're just kidding.

161
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,549
But we'd love to help you with your page.

162
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,352
What's his name?

163
00:07:44,402 --> 00:07:46,837
The Hamelin Flutist.

164
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:48,672
- That sounds fantastic.

165
00:07:48,722 --> 00:07:50,841
Why don't you send it to us and let us see it?

166
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:52,609
We could help you.

167
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,512
- Really?

168
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:55,697
Okay, yeah.

169
00:07:55,747 --> 00:08:00,368
Wow, it's always good that more people see her.

170
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:02,030
I already sent them to you.

171
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:10,194
They made fun of me.

172
00:08:10,244 --> 00:08:12,796
- Hey, no, man, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

173
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:14,499
Ricky, don't go.

174
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:16,084
My name is Richard, okay?

175
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:18,322
"The Flutist." "The Autist of the Fluutin."

176
00:08:21,305 --> 00:08:24,926
Gates, Ellison...

177
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:29,263
...Jobs, Dell.

178
00:08:29,313 --> 00:08:33,217
They all dropped out of college.

179
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:36,486
Silicon Valley is the cradle of innovation...

180
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:38,655
...thanks to the deserters.

181
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:43,027
The university has become a mockery...

182
00:08:43,177 --> 00:08:48,115
...very cruel and costly towards the poor and the middle class.

183
00:08:49,884 --> 00:08:54,088
It benefits only the perpetrators of the mockery.

184
00:08:54,138 --> 00:08:58,092
- You're very dangerous.

185
00:08:58,142 --> 00:08:59,761
Spit out ignorance.

186
00:08:59,811 --> 00:09:02,046
I don't think so.

187
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:04,748
I'm just saying we should trust ourselves...

188
00:09:04,798 --> 00:09:09,186
...more than in a system that happily produces unemployed debtors...

189
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:11,422
...and that provides a dubious value.

190
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:15,643
The true value of university education is intangible.

191
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:19,781
The true value of snake oil is also intangible.

192
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:23,332
Fascist.

193
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:27,756
Anything?

194
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:29,957
The usual on Twitter and Instagram.

195
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:32,680
Nothing I'd finance.

196
00:09:33,377 --> 00:09:35,946
Hi, excuse me, Mr. Gregory?

197
00:09:35,996 --> 00:09:38,565
I have an idea I'd like to explain to you, if you have time.

198
00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:44,305
Well, before I give up and go back to college.

199
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:46,624
Don't do that.

200
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:48,459
Get to work at Burger King.

201
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:50,761
Go into the woods and survive with nuts and berries.

202
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:53,302
Don't go back to college!

203
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,436
I think you manipulated me.

204
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:00,237
Okay, tell me your idea.

205
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:02,572
I'll give you until I fasten my seatbelt on my car.

206
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,308
I really appreciate it.

207
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:06,810
The Hamelin Flautist is a protected page that lets you know...

208
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,947
...if your music is violating pre-existing copyrights.

209
00:10:09,997 --> 00:10:12,966
So imagine you're a composer, okay?

210
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:15,203
I couldn't write a song.

211
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:18,122
Yeah, no... just imagine it is.

212
00:10:18,172 --> 00:10:22,059
I couldn't even say, "Hamelin's Flautist is a protected page."

213
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,378
Well, I said that, but it wasn't easy.

214
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:27,914
Hey, compress so many songs to find the same sounds...

215
00:10:27,964 --> 00:10:30,301
...would require incredible processing power.

216
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:32,303
- Right?

217
00:10:32,353 --> 00:10:34,388
That's right.

218
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:38,509
No, no, wait, I invented an algorithm.

219
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,822
Look, send me the link to your project and see how it goes.

220
00:10:43,114 --> 00:10:45,233
Yeah, great.

221
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:47,535
I uploaded the prototype to GitHub.

222
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:49,820
"Hamelin Flautist." I'll look for him there.

223
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,590
It's like the fable, you know, of the kids...

224
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,560
...and mice and music.

225
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:06,519
What a narrow car.

226
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:09,100
Fucking millionaires.

227
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:14,044
You want to see the "Nardo Wand" page?

228
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:15,617
Yes, I do.

229
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:21,601
Do you have to download your own player?

230
00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:26,528
Look at me. I have to travel to 2009.

231
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:30,728
Wait.

232
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:33,414
How much does that file weigh?

233
00:11:33,464 --> 00:11:35,934
1.2 megabytes?

234
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,424
Doesn't sound like I lost anything of quality.

235
00:11:42,006 --> 00:11:43,506
The file was halved.

236
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:47,878
And look how fast the search is.

237
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:51,299
Shit. How did you find her so fast?

238
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:56,387
It's like I'm looking for compressed files...

239
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:57,939
It can't be.

240
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:02,593
Look at the processing.

241
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:05,313
2.89.

242
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:07,615
Hey. Where were you?

243
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:09,950
We'll play the Multichannel Router in 5 minutes.

244
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,119
Well, how the hell did he get that?

245
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:14,861
And in compression nothing is lost.

246
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:22,099
And somehow he found out how to do a search...

247
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:24,334
...in a compressed data space.

248
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:27,117
- Oh, my God.

249
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,102
And I don't think he's even realized what he accomplished.

250
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:31,305
He uses it for a silly application for composers.

251
00:12:31,355 --> 00:12:34,057
They're all like this, they're only interested in consumers.

252
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:35,760
Yeah, but if you use something like this...

253
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,728
...you give him the business approach and you turn him into the business...

254
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:43,467
...the applications will be infinite.

255
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:45,803
Hey, I thought you were a Satanist.

256
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:49,896
I am a Laveyan Satanist with certain theistic tendencies.

257
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:51,492
"Certain Theistic Trends."

258
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:52,976
Then why the cross?

259
00:12:53,026 --> 00:12:55,112
It's a head cross.

260
00:12:55,162 --> 00:12:59,817
No, it's not from here.

261
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:02,870
I see. You know what you should do?

262
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,623
Make you another tattoo that says "this side up."

263
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:07,257
How do you say this in Persian?

264
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:09,010
I don't speak that language.

265
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,797
It happened that Frontier Airlines liked mine, Aviato.

266
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:14,965
And that's how I got where I am.

267
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:17,635
So, what's your idea?

268
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:20,721
All right, here it goes, Bits soup.

269
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:22,723
All right, here it goes, Bits soup.

270
00:13:22,773 --> 00:13:25,775
It's like letter soup, but...

271
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:29,716
...with ones and zeros, instead of letters.

272
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:35,403
Because it's binary, binary language only has one and zeros.

273
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:36,953
Yeah, I know what binary is.

274
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:39,189
Good heavens, I learned the hexadecimal boards...

275
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:41,525
...at 14, when I was writing code!

276
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:43,861
Ask me how much is 9 times F.

277
00:13:43,911 --> 00:13:45,579
It's fefenta and fake.

278
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:47,715
I don't need you to tell me what the binary is...

279
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:51,634
...how I don't need you to think about soup or take pictures of it.

280
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:54,371
Think about apps, programs, websites.

281
00:13:54,421 --> 00:13:57,019
This is Silicon Valley, not...

282
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:02,914
Paris, Texas.

283
00:14:03,564 --> 00:14:05,683
Where the Campbell Soups are.

284
00:14:09,203 --> 00:14:11,355
Hooli's calling again.

285
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:12,690
I'm sure those programmers...

286
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,025
They're dying to tell me that my page is stupid.

287
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:16,527
Idiots.

288
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:20,948
Hi, I'm Richard Hendricks, a fucking retard.

289
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:25,369
Hi, I'm Jared Dunn, I'm calling from Hooli.

290
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:27,538
I'm calling from Gavin Belson.

291
00:14:27,588 --> 00:14:30,507
I didn't mean to...

292
00:14:30,558 --> 00:14:34,128
Gavin is very interested in your application of the "Hamelin Flutist"...

293
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:37,645
...and we wanted to know if you could come to a meeting with us.

294
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:39,800
<i>- Can you now? </i> - Sure.

295
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,351
Okay, we'll be right here.

296
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:43,438
Yeah, yeah, bye.

297
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:48,075
I've got a meeting with Gavin Belson.

298
00:14:48,275 --> 00:14:50,293
Ten percent of the "Flautist" is mine.

299
00:14:50,343 --> 00:14:51,645
You said it was a terrible idea.

300
00:14:51,695 --> 00:14:53,764
It was a terrible idea.

301
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:55,116
I don't know what it is now.

302
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,568
- What time will you see him?

303
00:14:57,618 --> 00:15:01,622
I need another shirt.

304
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:03,690
- Oh, my God.

305
00:15:04,157 --> 00:15:06,588
What the hell am I waiting for?

306
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:21,258
...as Gavin says, "It takes a change to make a change."

307
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:24,678
Yeah, I think I saw it on some sign.

308
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:27,681
- Hey.

309
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:29,683
Gavin was 30 minutes late...

310
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:34,237
...but you must know he's very excited to see you, Richard.

311
00:15:34,288 --> 00:15:35,823
He's with his spiritual counselor.

312
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:37,574
It shouldn't take long now.

313
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,978
I'm a vice president, and I only see him ten minutes a month.

314
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:45,081
Yeah, but those ten minutes are amazing.

315
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:47,952
I heard Richard Hendricks is here.

316
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:49,919
And you know Gavin?

317
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,505
- No. - No?

318
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:54,542
I told you, it's amazing.

319
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:57,712
That doesn't even begin to describe it.

320
00:16:00,014 --> 00:16:02,216
It's weird.

321
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:04,835
They always travel in groups of five.

322
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:08,438
There's always a tall, skinny target...

323
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:10,607
...an Asian chaparro and skinny...

324
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:12,226
...a fat man with a horsetail...

325
00:16:12,276 --> 00:16:14,011
...one with strange facial hair...

326
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:17,198
...and then one of the East Indies.

327
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:22,069
It's like they swap until the group is finally ordered.

328
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:26,519
It shows your deep understanding of humanity.

329
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:32,928
And Gavin said, "I'm not humiliating you, I'm raising you up."

330
00:16:33,146 --> 00:16:34,748
Gavin.

331
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:43,973
This is Richard.

332
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:46,123
It's Peter Gregory.

333
00:16:48,378 --> 00:16:49,462
No.

334
00:16:51,065 --> 00:16:53,882
- I'm coming.

335
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,936
Why are you walking so fast?

336
00:16:55,986 --> 00:16:58,022
Because we have a meeting with Gavin Belson.

337
00:16:58,072 --> 00:16:59,648
- Not really...

338
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:10,734
I'm outside Gavin Belson's office right now, Mr. Gregory.

339
00:17:10,784 --> 00:17:13,871
Here it comes, so can I call you back later?

340
00:17:13,921 --> 00:17:17,175
So here's Richard Hendricks.

341
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:19,444
Gavin.

342
00:17:19,694 --> 00:17:22,096
- There you are, Richard.

343
00:17:22,146 --> 00:17:24,748
I'm sorry these gentlemen kept you waiting.

344
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:26,100
- So, to the point, what you did, I loved it.

345
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,469
- So, to the point, what you did, I loved it.

346
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,554
- Get him up to speed, Jared.

347
00:17:30,604 --> 00:17:33,590
As you know, Hooli is considered possibly...

348
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,559
...the most progressive company in the world.

349
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:38,145
It's partly due to Gavin's commitment to social justice...

350
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:40,863
...but in part it's because of your personal commitment...

351
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:43,032
...with the people who work in Hooli.

352
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,320
Based on that, Gavin is willing to give you a very good pay raise...

353
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,787
...and a corresponding promotion.

354
00:17:47,838 --> 00:17:49,623
Ten percent is mine.

355
00:17:49,673 --> 00:17:51,909
He created it while living in my incubator.

356
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:55,329
Erlich Bachman, this is Cabezón.

357
00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:59,500
I don't know what that means, but I'll give you $600,000 for it.

358
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,385
We have the scope and the resources to take what you did...

359
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:05,139
...and push it to a global level.

360
00:18:05,189 --> 00:18:08,309
It's a generous offer.

361
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,570
I'm sorry.

362
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:14,598
No, it's not true, it's not...

363
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:18,153
Here it is, it's Peter Gregory.

364
00:18:18,203 --> 00:18:20,771
I don't know how he got my number.

365
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:22,139
I'm Richard.

366
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:25,308
I'll give you $3 million now.

367
00:18:25,358 --> 00:18:30,147
Gavin Belson just offered me $3 million for "The Flutist."

368
00:18:30,197 --> 00:18:33,367
I'm willing to give you $300,000.

369
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:38,205
Peter Gregory just offered me 300... Did he say 300 grand?

370
00:18:38,255 --> 00:18:39,823
Peter Gregory just offered me 300... Did he say 300 grand?

371
00:18:39,873 --> 00:18:41,674
For ten percent of your company.

372
00:18:41,725 --> 00:18:44,327
Well, four million.

373
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:46,496
200 grand.

374
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:48,165
Five percent.

375
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:50,684
Now he offers me less.

376
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:54,337
No, you're still worth four million dollars.

377
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:58,941
But you own 95 percent of a potentially multimillion dollar company.

378
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:02,696
And not only that: I'll help you build that company.

379
00:19:02,746 --> 00:19:05,182
I'll introduce you to the people you need to meet...

380
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:07,401
...and I'll give you the advice you need.

381
00:19:07,451 --> 00:19:11,188
I'll keep a small part, but the company will belong to you.

382
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:14,908
<i>No to Gavin Belson.</i>

383
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,861
<i>You have until tomorrow to decide.</i>

384
00:19:18,711 --> 00:19:20,330
Okay.

385
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:23,800
- Cut the crap, Richard.

386
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:26,872
I'm offering you $4 million now.

387
00:19:28,922 --> 00:19:31,592
I'm...

388
00:19:31,642 --> 00:19:33,245
It's a lot of money.

389
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,232
I think I've got...

390
00:19:38,282 --> 00:19:40,517
I have to go to the bathroom.

391
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:42,102
I'm gonna pee.

392
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:44,554
I'm getting urgent, I'm exploding.

393
00:19:44,604 --> 00:19:46,190
I'll be right back, but for the moment...

394
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,557
Well, ten million.

395
00:19:47,607 --> 00:19:50,326
No, maybe.

396
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:51,728
The "no" wasn't for you.

397
00:19:51,778 --> 00:19:53,631
We'll keep... talking.

398
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:55,535
I won't be long.

399
00:20:01,922 --> 00:20:03,339
A little more of me...

400
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,674
...I'm the founder of Aviato...

401
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:07,294
...and own a very small percentage of Grindr...

402
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:10,297
...a dating page between men...

403
00:20:10,347 --> 00:20:12,249
...with which you find men 15 km around...

404
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:15,269
...interested in having sex in a public bathroom.

405
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:18,439
In the gay community sometimes, anonymously-- I know what Grindr is. I have gay friends.

406
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:21,274
In the gay community sometimes, anonymously-- I know what Grindr is. I have gay friends.

407
00:20:32,085 --> 00:20:33,787
Then you'll survive.

408
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:36,439
It was just a common panic attack.

409
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:38,275
Welcome to Silicon Valley.

410
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:39,993
We serve people like you all the time.

411
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:41,795
Really?

412
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:43,914
I just have to make a decision by tomorrow.

413
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:45,799
Yeah, you know what, it's been a while...

414
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:47,801
...attended a man in almost the same situation...

415
00:20:47,851 --> 00:20:50,754
"Accept the money or keep the company."

416
00:20:50,804 --> 00:20:51,972
And what happened?

417
00:20:52,022 --> 00:20:54,675
Well... two months later...

418
00:20:54,725 --> 00:20:57,928
...they brought him to the E.R. with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

419
00:20:57,978 --> 00:21:00,130
I think he was very sorry he didn't accept the money.

420
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,267
He shot himself because he didn't take the money?

421
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:04,968
Yeah.

422
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:07,236
Or not, he took the money.

423
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:08,956
Or not.

424
00:21:09,006 --> 00:21:10,607
He didn't... he didn't... you know what?

425
00:21:10,657 --> 00:21:12,326
I don't remember, but in any case...

426
00:21:12,376 --> 00:21:14,076
...he repented so much that he ended up shooting himself...

427
00:21:14,127 --> 00:21:16,163
- and lost his sight.

428
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:18,199
Yeah, when you're thinking of shooting yourself...

429
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:19,867
Don't hold the gun against your temple, okay?

430
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:22,618
Because that's how he blew up both optic nerves and then...

431
00:21:22,686 --> 00:21:24,204
...you know, half the face.

432
00:21:24,254 --> 00:21:26,874
And his wife abandoned him because, well...

433
00:21:26,924 --> 00:21:28,843
- Of course.

434
00:21:28,893 --> 00:21:32,159
Maybe he was a genius as a programmer, but he didn't know anything about human anatomy.

435
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,297
Yeah.

436
00:21:33,347 --> 00:21:35,349
And no decision-making either.

437
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:36,833
Now you have to live with that...

438
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:39,502
...and the terrible decision you made about the money.

439
00:21:40,252 --> 00:21:44,858
And what should I do if I feel like I'm going to have another panic attack?

440
00:21:45,608 --> 00:21:48,478
Would you be interested in a device...

441
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:51,148
...that links to your phone, keeps a record...

442
00:21:51,198 --> 00:21:53,683
...of your vital signs and tells you, even before it happens...

443
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:56,636
...if you're having a panic attack or a heart attack?

444
00:21:56,686 --> 00:21:58,405
Yeah, that'd be great.

445
00:21:58,455 --> 00:22:01,909
It would be, wouldn't it?

446
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:04,126
...because we're still in the prototype stage...

447
00:22:04,177 --> 00:22:05,662
...but my partners and I are looking for investors...

448
00:22:05,712 --> 00:22:08,048
...just like today, so please let me know...

449
00:22:08,098 --> 00:22:09,333
Here's my number.

450
00:22:09,383 --> 00:22:11,084
If you take the $10 million...

451
00:22:11,134 --> 00:22:14,804
...because we could really make the world a better place.

452
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:17,882
Oh, my God.

453
00:22:24,698 --> 00:22:25,899
Richard.

454
00:22:25,949 --> 00:22:28,769
Hi, I'm Monica, I work with Peter Gregory.

455
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:31,153
- We met at the conference.

456
00:22:31,204 --> 00:22:34,257
But... how did you know I was here?

457
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,909
Peter Gregory invested in a company...

458
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,696
...that uses GPS phones to track people.

459
00:22:39,746 --> 00:22:41,198
That's scary.

460
00:22:41,248 --> 00:22:43,400
And you don't know half of it.

461
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,469
Not even Congress.

462
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:50,374
Look, I don't want to waste your time.

463
00:22:50,424 --> 00:22:52,842
I think I'll take Gavin Belson's money.

464
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,928
So, when I blow my eyes...

465
00:22:54,978 --> 00:22:58,180
At least there'll be some money left for my family.

466
00:22:58,231 --> 00:22:59,299
Oh, my God.

467
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:03,604
I'm sorry. lt's really terrible the doctor over there.

468
00:23:03,854 --> 00:23:08,649
Richard, under your ugly user interface there's a compression algorithm...

469
00:23:08,684 --> 00:23:11,445
...that drove our engineering team crazy.

470
00:23:11,495 --> 00:23:13,814
And what do you think Hooli will do with it?

471
00:23:13,864 --> 00:23:15,949
I don't know, that's their problem.

472
00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:17,234
This is your creation.

473
00:23:17,284 --> 00:23:19,620
Do you even realize the impact that a compression...

474
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,655
...that good you can have in the world?

475
00:23:21,705 --> 00:23:24,124
You'd have any files on your phone in an instant.

476
00:23:24,174 --> 00:23:27,327
Navigation data for cars driving alone...

477
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:28,762
...mobile medical imaging...

478
00:23:28,812 --> 00:23:32,381
...all transmitting without loss of quality.

479
00:23:32,432 --> 00:23:34,574
It's a revolutionary thing.

480
00:23:35,352 --> 00:23:38,171
And you don't want to be behind the wheel when that happens?

481
00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:41,809
Do you really want to give it to Hooli and leave?

482
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,147
Well... well, you're not making it any easier for me.

483
00:23:47,197 --> 00:23:48,631
I don't intend to.

484
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:50,150
No, you really make me feel worse.

485
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,686
My hands tingly, my mouth tastes like metal.

486
00:23:52,736 --> 00:23:55,272
And I can't go back there, so I'm going home.

487
00:23:55,322 --> 00:23:57,941
Hey, let me take you home.

488
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,896
All right, thank you.

489
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:03,913
Dude, where were you?

490
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:05,247
Why didn't you answer your phone?

491
00:24:05,298 --> 00:24:07,334
This got way beyond AngelList, man.

492
00:24:07,384 --> 00:24:10,820
Andreesen, Elevation and a lot of seed capitals are piling up.

493
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,205
They've been calling Erlich.

494
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:14,090
He's crazy.

495
00:24:14,141 --> 00:24:15,560
Yeah.

496
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:20,928
What if we accepted Gregory's 200,000 and founded our company?

497
00:24:21,014 --> 00:24:22,681
Did I hear you say "our"?

498
00:24:22,732 --> 00:24:24,668
Exactly who do you mean?

499
00:24:24,718 --> 00:24:27,637
I mean you, me, Dinesh, Cabezón: us.

500
00:24:27,687 --> 00:24:29,672
Because now "The Flutist" is just audio...

501
00:24:29,722 --> 00:24:32,142
...but I think of ways to compress images, video...

502
00:24:32,192 --> 00:24:35,747
Maybe Peter Gregory is right and this could be huge.

503
00:24:35,912 --> 00:24:38,065
Listen, for thousands of years...

504
00:24:38,115 --> 00:24:40,701
...people like us have been kicked to shit.

505
00:24:40,751 --> 00:24:43,653
But now, for the first time we live in a time...

506
00:24:43,703 --> 00:24:47,074
...where we can take over and build empires.

507
00:24:47,124 --> 00:24:50,159
We could be the Vikings of our era.

508
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,628
- Vikings?

509
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,749
You look, frankly, super fucked up.

510
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,968
Who swallowed my fucking quinoa again?

511
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:01,305
Hey, are you really about to tell Erlich...

512
00:25:01,336 --> 00:25:02,706
...that you won't have your million dollars?

513
00:25:02,755 --> 00:25:04,891
Yeah, I don't want to be present when you do.

514
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:06,561
I do want to be present when you do.

515
00:25:06,611 --> 00:25:09,138
Stay here, please.

516
00:25:11,698 --> 00:25:12,880
Hey.

517
00:25:17,302 --> 00:25:22,251
I've been thinking about this Peter Gregory and Gavin Belson thing.

518
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:27,164
And... I think I'm going to opt for Peter Gregory.

519
00:25:28,415 --> 00:25:31,001
- Which means... - Richard.

520
00:25:31,551 --> 00:25:35,623
I know when you look at me, you see someone who's got it all figured out.

521
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:39,376
And you're practically right, I got it.

522
00:25:39,426 --> 00:25:40,927
The one who sold Aviato...

523
00:25:40,977 --> 00:25:44,714
...give me a house, money, expensive clothes...

524
00:25:44,764 --> 00:25:46,749
...the universal respect of all girls.

525
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,519
But there's always been a hole in my heart.

526
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,255
Not a literal hole, like the one you'd see...

527
00:25:52,305 --> 00:25:55,142
...in babies with congenital diseases...

528
00:25:55,192 --> 00:25:57,243
...but a metaphorical hole.

529
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,695
I think that hole is the "if there was."

530
00:25:59,746 --> 00:26:03,816
What if I hadn't sold?

531
00:26:04,484 --> 00:26:07,103
What I guess I'm saying is...

532
00:26:07,153 --> 00:26:09,439
...that you're like me, Richard.

533
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:13,041
You want to build something and bring it to term.

534
00:26:14,127 --> 00:26:16,378
So just so I'm clear...

535
00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:18,632
Don't you get mad at me if I say "no" to a deal...

536
00:26:18,682 --> 00:26:20,883
...that I would pay you a million dollars immediately?

537
00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:22,718
No, Richard, it's not like I'm not mad.

538
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:24,887
I'm just excited.

539
00:26:24,938 --> 00:26:28,493
Let's see how high this rocket can fly, partner.

540
00:26:31,144 --> 00:26:32,813
Okay.

541
00:26:33,563 --> 00:26:34,965
It's amazing.

542
00:26:36,015 --> 00:26:38,468
Not exactly partners.

543
00:26:38,518 --> 00:26:41,605
But everything else is amazing.

544
00:26:41,655 --> 00:26:43,723
Call it whatever you want.

545
00:26:46,126 --> 00:26:48,695
Always blue, always blue, always blue...

546
00:26:48,745 --> 00:26:51,481
...always blue, always blue, always blue...

547
00:26:51,531 --> 00:26:53,500
...always blue, always...

548
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,168
That was yellow.

549
00:26:55,218 --> 00:26:56,486
How many were there?

550
00:26:56,536 --> 00:26:58,455
- Pretty good.

551
00:26:58,505 --> 00:27:00,723
Hey, can I say something?

552
00:27:00,974 --> 00:27:03,293
I think it's kind of stupid, but...

553
00:27:03,343 --> 00:27:05,662
I just want to say that...

554
00:27:05,712 --> 00:27:09,683
I want this company to be completely different from Hooli...

555
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:11,685
...and Goolybib and all the others.

556
00:27:11,735 --> 00:27:14,804
Let's not turn her into a corporate cult...

557
00:27:14,854 --> 00:27:16,890
...with bike joints and voluntary retreats...

558
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,726
...which are actually mandatory...

559
00:27:18,776 --> 00:27:21,844
...and let's not declare all the time that we're improving the world.

560
00:27:21,894 --> 00:27:25,198
Just... think differently.

561
00:27:25,248 --> 00:27:27,517
Don't "think differently." That's Apple.

562
00:27:29,703 --> 00:27:31,521
Just... just do it.

563
00:27:31,571 --> 00:27:33,173
That's Nike, man.

564
00:27:33,223 --> 00:27:34,224
Yeah.

565
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:37,810
Fuck it, I don't know, let's make it possible.

566
00:27:38,044 --> 00:27:40,047
Yeah, all right.

567
00:27:40,597 --> 00:27:42,666
For your charity.

568
00:27:42,716 --> 00:27:44,334
Peter Gregory?

569
00:27:44,384 --> 00:27:47,003
- Of course, the dark lord.

570
00:27:47,053 --> 00:27:49,091
Bighead.

571
00:27:51,141 --> 00:27:52,926
Drugged is worse.

572
00:27:55,895 --> 00:28:00,316
Always blue, always blue, always blue, always blue...

573
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:06,345
