2
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,520
Red.

2
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,520
Red.

2
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,520
Red.

2
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,520
Red.

2
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,520
Red.

3
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,160
Red.

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Red.

5
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,360
Red.

6
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,560
Red.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,040
Red.

8
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
Red.

9
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,119
Holy shit, have you seen the virtual campus?

10
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,400
Today the Culture class is in classroom 110.

11
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,400
Well, let's go over there, otherwise there won't be any room...

12
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
No, we had breakfast, we relaxed and already...

13
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,439
Well, I was already in the mood to sit down with my fellows, who'd stick their hands in my back.

14
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,560
Well, I was already in the mood to sit down with my fellows, who'd stick their hands in my back.

15
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,479
Aren't you angry?

16
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,000
The exercise is good.

17
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,200
In addition, the Ball is the bomb as a teacher.

18
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,720
But let's see, explain it to me.

19
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,600
I mean, did she tell you I'd be late for class?

20
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,200
No, no. He told us that if someone was late, he would ask us the color of the folder and that we would say red.

21
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,280
No, no. He told us that if someone was late, he would ask us the color of the folder and that we would say red.

22
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,760
No, no. He told us that if someone was late, he would ask us the color of the folder and that we would say red.

23
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,640
It's just that if you think about it, it's good.

24
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,600
But he's got a cruel little dot.

25
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,959
You won't say it for me.

26
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:17,479
I'm going there, and then there won't be room and there won't be...

27
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,680
Save for everyone.

28
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,920
But there's class at 110?

29
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,280
How do you like to play, huh?

30
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,840
To the ball more.

31
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,200
And now, repeat all with me.

32
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,840
Once again.

33
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
You know, I don't think you're that calm.

34
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,720
After the "momentazo" that made you pass the Ball...

35
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:20,800
- No, man, but first it doesn't fix your job, now this...

36
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,959
- No, man, but first it doesn't fix your job, now this...

37
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:25,959
What's wrong with you?

38
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:28,160
But you followed the game, that pisses me off.

39
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,920
You could have told me he was going to play with me.

40
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,239
First you go as a friend, but then, take it!

41
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,680
Don't be mad, we'll have a beer tonight and we'll disconnect.

42
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,840
Don't be mad, we'll have a beer tonight and we'll disconnect.

43
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,479
Okay.

44
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,439
- On the floor of Minerva.

45
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,000
I just talked to her, she's got a beautiful terrace.

46
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,840
I'll tell you, I'm keeping track of working hours.

47
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,200
Dude, what are you doing in a fucking parking lot?

48
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,520
Do as Minerva, quit the job.

49
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:26,720
Hi, Rai.

50
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
What's up?

51
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,600
How's it going, Schopenhauer?

52
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,840
We haven't gotten to him yet.

53
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:38,119
I also know a little bit of philosophy.

54
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,400
I think so.

55
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,080
Your mother's in the garden.

56
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,400
Distracted, reading...

57
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,800
Where the hell is Saint Peter of Verona?

58
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,800
Mom!

59
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,119
Is it true you stole my painting?

60
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,520
You're talking about robbery?

61
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,320
Did you steal it from the grandparents by taking advantage of the fact that they were at Calella's house?

62
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,879
Did you steal it from the grandparents by taking advantage of the fact that they were at Calella's house?

63
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
I saved the painting.

64
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,080
Your husband would've taken out four tough ones.

65
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,439
Are you trying to justify you breaking into grandparents' house?

66
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,840
Are you trying to justify you breaking into grandparents' house?

67
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,000
Let's calm down a little? -An Italian expert in Baroque painting will go to the auction house in Madrid.

68
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,720
Let's calm down a little? -An Italian expert in Baroque painting will go to the auction house in Madrid.

69
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:36,160
Julia wants me to certify if the painting can be attributed to Claudio Coello. I don't know if you know who it is.

70
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,400
Julia wants me to certify if the painting can be attributed to Claudio Coello. I don't know if you know who it is.

71
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,840
Look, two little things.

72
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,360
First, Julia get fucked, yeah, fuck Julia.

73
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,200
And second, you send the Italian a picture and shit.

74
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,479
Is this the philosophy of your new career?

75
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,560
- Will you shut up, please?

76
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,119
Victoria, it's attributable to Coello. I told you, it looks a lot like the Santo Domingo Museum in Budapest.

77
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,080
Victoria, it's attributable to Coello. I told you, it looks a lot like the Santo Domingo Museum in Budapest.

78
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,920
Maybe the Italian won't be necessary.

79
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,920
Now all of a sudden you're interested in painting?

80
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,920
If you don't even come near the auction house.

81
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,600
Look, let the painting stay.

82
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,320
And tomorrow you come to the inauguration of the new exhibition.

83
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,800
So you show a little interest in mom's work.

84
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,959
And I don't like you talking to him like that.

85
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,720
You're going, huh, Rai?

86
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,760
I'm going.

87
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,600
Until tomorrow. -Bye.

88
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,879
No, Gloria, I don't understand classical music and stuff.

89
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,560
No, Gloria, I don't understand classical music and stuff.

90
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,640
- I'm tired of arguing.

91
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,720
It's okay.

92
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,560
Enjoy the concert.

93
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,439
Gloria, you look beautiful.

94
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,280
Thank you, at least you tell me.

95
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,520
What's the first thing I told you?

96
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,439
Your father doesn't want to accompany me to a piano concert.

97
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:58,720
See if you calm him down, I can't and I'll be late.

98
00:10:58,879 --> 00:10:59,879
I'm leaving, too.

99
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,479
Look who I've met.

100
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,760
All right.

101
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,640
Well, what a pimp this is, isn't it?

102
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,760
It's a fucking guy.

103
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,959
Funny, French, pianist...

104
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:24,400
Well, he's got everything, isn't he?

105
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:26,800
And Rai with whom does he speak?

106
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,119
You have to meet her.

107
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,320
It's a "person."

108
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
- Hey.

109
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,080
Amy O'Connor, I'm from Eugene, Origin.

110
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,640
Watch out he's got a gun under his pillow.

111
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,760
- Okay, listen.

112
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
No, of course.

113
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,879
- I said...

114
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,840
Like a tradition.

115
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,720
A tradition, like Halloween, right?

116
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,600
- I know it's not the same, you don't understand because you don't listen.

117
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,640
Pol, listen.

118
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,320
No, wait a minute, wait a minute.

119
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,800
Not bad, no, the question. Think a little.

120
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,000
You call the police and wait?

121
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,520
I'm sorry about your family, but they're all dead.

122
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,800
My father has a hunting shotgun...

123
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,280
I mean, if he comes in and steals from you, they wouldn't steal anything from me.

124
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:32,400
Does family deserve you to kill for them?

125
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,119
Okay, guys, that's enough. I've got the final debate.

126
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,520
- Do we have the ass we deserve?

127
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,920
I do.

128
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,040
I do.

129
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,720
Play, play.

130
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,879
- I love it.

131
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,479
Don't I have a good ass?

132
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,560
It's nice, isn't it?

133
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
- Bye.

134
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,239
Fuck, Pol, are you yawning already, man?

135
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,200
That's why you'd better not come, stay home.

136
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,080
The butler is waiting for you at the door, or what?

137
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,040
I came by myself.

138
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:04,400
Did you get the subway?

139
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,720
Don't get too attached, man.

140
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,119
Be happy, put your money on a chauffeur.

141
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,959
You're one of those who think money is happiness, aren't you?

142
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:13,119
I don't know.

143
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,640
What do you think?

144
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,600
I think...

145
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,800
I'm the only philosophy student who doesn't care if the career has a way out.

146
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,439
I'm the only philosophy student who doesn't care if the career has a way out.

147
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,320
Go on, go on.

148
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,600
Well, it's very simple.

149
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,879
There are things in my life that don't work, but...

150
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,959
I'm so relaxed!

151
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,479
No, there's more, there's still more.

152
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,720
When we're 40 years old, you'll look... 50 and me, 35.

153
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,239
When we're 40 years old, you'll look... 50 and me, 35.

154
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,439
When we're 40 years old, you'll look... 50 and me, 35.

155
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,560
What bulbs? The green ones or the red ones?

156
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,360
Can you help me, Pol, I don't know right now, I don't...

157
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,879
Who were you a year ago?

158
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,560
Who were you?

159
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,200
Who were you with?

160
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,520
Didn't you have any posh friends?

161
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,040
Yeah, yeah, I'm expired.

162
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,520
What are you doing? Are you looking for friends among the poor?

163
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,400
Why do you get so low? Isn't that what you need us for?

164
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Impossible, isn't it?

165
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,360
You could be home, without stress, slowly aging and surrounded by the family.

166
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,720
You could be home, without stress, slowly aging and surrounded by the family.

167
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,320
Hey, Pol, don't fuck off!

168
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,800
Hey, Pol, don't fuck off!

169
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:00,040
- No, no, stay.

170
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,400
Stay, I stole a beer from the American.

171
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
See if there's any luck and we don't get shot.

172
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,000
Long live Mississippi!

173
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,239
You, today in class, when the Ball has done the folder exercise, I wanted to hug you.

174
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,040
You, today in class, when the Ball has done the folder exercise, I wanted to hug you.

175
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,959
You, today in class, when the Ball has done the folder exercise, I wanted to hug you.

176
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:20,439
You, today in class, when the Ball has done the folder exercise, I wanted to hug you.

177
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
Look, that's it.

178
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,920
Okay, okay.

179
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,879
Oti... go.

180
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,040
Okay. All right, all right, please!

181
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:39,239
I like you very much, but I don't want anything with you, okay?

182
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,239
I just think Amy's beer goes up a lot.

183
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,959
It's okay.

184
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,040
You can go upstairs and give you some air.

185
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,720
No, no, I'd better go home.

186
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,200
- It's not uncommon for us to throw the shingles at you.

187
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:20,600
I don't understand French.

188
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,720
I understand.

189
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:44,320
The Catalans are very discreet.

190
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,320
How's the party?

191
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,080
Good.

192
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,520
Oh, he called Oriol.

193
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,600
Don't call him Oriol, who's my father.

194
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:34,879
I'd like to know if we'll be up on Sunday.

195
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,920
They're setting up a barbecue.

196
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
No, I don't want to go.

197
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,239
It's just that my father gives me a stick with his monologues on football.

198
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
You've had a drink, haven't you?

199
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,439
A little bit.

200
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,600
Well, I'd love to go up to town.

201
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,160
Let's see people.

202
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,800
Fuck, what "heavy"!

203
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,239
I'm staying here.

204
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,879
It's just that I've discovered...

205
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,160
I'm cosmopolitan.

206
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,800
It's confirmed: you've been drinking.

207
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,280
Come on, let's go to sleep. "No, you sleep here, I want to sleep wide in bed.

208
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,520
Come on, let's go to sleep. "No, you sleep here, I want to sleep wide in bed.

209
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,320
And so I put myself on a cross, and undo it when I feel like it.

210
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:20,560
And so I put myself on a cross, and undo it when I feel like it.

211
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,600
And you're going to leave me alone?

212
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,520
It makes me so bad that you have some gray hair...

213
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,000
Oh, yeah?

214
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,320
Sorry, you can't sit here.

215
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,959
Looks like an 80-year-old lady died who came as a listener and didn't...

216
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,800
Looks like an 80-year-old lady died who came as a listener and didn't...

217
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,400
Don't you want to know what he did a year ago?

218
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,600
A year ago, I realized that my father cheated on my grandfather to steal his company.

219
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,560
A year ago, I realized that my father cheated on my grandfather to steal his company.

220
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,040
A year ago, I realized that my father cheated on my grandfather to steal his company.

221
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,800
And I was very touched, because I realized that I look like my father.

222
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,800
And I was very touched, because I realized that I look like my father.

223
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,160
And yes, I recognize that sometimes...

224
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,920
I can give you a little rage.

225
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,520
More like a lot of rage.

226
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,720
A lot.

227
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,239
One to zero.

228
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,520
One to zero from what?

229
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,439
Well, I've explained one thing to you...

230
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
staff that, for me, is not pleasant.

231
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
And you?

232
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,840
Do you have any weak points you want to explain to me?

233
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,360
According to Aristóteles, who had to have the best flutes were the best flute players.

234
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,840
According to Aristóteles, who had to have the best flutes were the best flute players.

235
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,640
According to Aristóteles, who had to have the best flutes were the best flute players.

236
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,479
It was a way to reward them for their musical virtue.

237
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,959
It was a way to reward them for their musical virtue.

238
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
In politics it would also have to be so, that the most exemplary citizens were those who agreed to the political charges of the most responsibility.

239
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,879
In politics it would also have to be so, that the most exemplary citizens were those who agreed to the political charges of the most responsibility.

240
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,520
In politics it would also have to be so, that the most exemplary citizens were those who agreed to the political charges of the most responsibility.

241
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,800
Plato and Aristótela had it very clear: politics has to be decent because an indecent destroys everything that rules.

242
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,680
Plato and Aristótela had it very clear: politics has to be decent because an indecent destroys everything that rules.

243
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,200
Plato and Aristótela had it very clear: politics has to be decent because an indecent destroys everything that rules.

244
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
And you, if in the future you were dedicated to politics, would you be intelligent?

245
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,920
And you, if in the future you were dedicated to politics, would you be intelligent?

246
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:12,080
And you, if in the future you were dedicated to politics, would you be intelligent?

247
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,640
We all know we don't have to steal.

248
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,520
Fuck, what an exemplary class.

249
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,879
If the boss pays me an extra in black money, I love it.

250
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,959
What's wrong?

251
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,959
Let's see, Silvia, the first day of class you told us that the associate teachers will charge, at most, 500 euros.

252
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:27,479
Let's see, Silvia, the first day of class you told us that the associate teachers will charge, at most, 500 euros.

253
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,760
Let's see, Silvia, the first day of class you told us that the associate teachers will charge, at most, 500 euros.

254
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,439
I see you want to cheer me up today.

255
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,320
Okay, excuse me. Also, university fees are scandalously high and to the many who ask for a scholarship, or we approve everything or they throw us out.

256
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:34,920
Okay, excuse me. Also, university fees are scandalously high and to the many who ask for a scholarship, or we approve everything or they throw us out.

257
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,080
Okay, excuse me. Also, university fees are scandalously high and to the many who ask for a scholarship, or we approve everything or they throw us out.

258
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:40,439
Faced with this panorama, who of you would reject an envelope with money? Come on, raise your hand.

259
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Faced with this panorama, who of you would reject an envelope with money? Come on, raise your hand.

260
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:50,800
It is clear that the Treasury should not be let down and that moral principles should be those, but the problem is that people move away from the system because it is very punishing.

261
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:53,600
It is clear that the Treasury should not be let down and that moral principles should be those, but the problem is that people move away from the system because it is very punishing.

262
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,320
It is clear that the Treasury should not be let down and that moral principles should be those, but the problem is that people move away from the system because it is very punishing.

263
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:57,720
It is clear that the Treasury should not be let down and that moral principles should be those, but the problem is that people move away from the system because it is very punishing.

264
00:25:58,479 --> 00:26:00,320
Could you explain it a little more?

265
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
Well, I don't know, my father a few years ago...

266
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,040
Well, I don't know, my father a few years ago...

267
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,800
I'm serious, listen to me.

268
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
And he, for being punctual and working well, was paid a bonus.

269
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,560
And he, for being punctual and working well, was paid a bonus.

270
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,920
So why does the system not reward exemplary citizens?

271
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,600
So why does the system not reward exemplary citizens?

272
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
Paying taxes is your obligation.

273
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,439
Okay, but I insist, there are millions of people paying their taxes all their lives and in the end, what do they receive when they retire?

274
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,640
Okay, but I insist, there are millions of people paying their taxes all their lives and in the end, what do they receive when they retire?

275
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,720
Okay, but I insist, there are millions of people paying their taxes all their lives and in the end, what do they receive when they retire?

276
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:29,520
-Pol, you're an anti-system.

277
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,920
Marqués de Casamiquela, I love the system.

278
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,479
The problem is that the system doesn't want me.

279
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,879
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

280
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,000
Pol, the system has to monitor and punish the corrupt, otherwise everything goes to hell.

281
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,280
Pol, the system has to monitor and punish the corrupt, otherwise everything goes to hell.

282
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:42,879
Pol, the system has to monitor and punish the corrupt, otherwise everything goes to hell.

283
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:45,439
Let's see, Biel, a little thing, who cares about a parent who only punishes?

284
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,840
Let's see, Biel, a little thing, who cares about a parent who only punishes?

285
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,280
We also like to be pampered a little, don't we?

286
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:54,720
And why are our good deeds not rewarded?

287
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,560
I wonder: wouldn't the fraudsters diminish if they rewarded us when we behaved well?

288
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,119
I wonder: wouldn't the fraudsters diminish if they rewarded us when we behaved well?

289
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,720
Wouldn't there be less corrupt?

290
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:03,680
It's a question I leave in the air.

291
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,800
Honestly, if I spend my life paying my taxes religiously, I'd like to receive a letter from the IRS saying...

292
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,959
Honestly, if I spend my life paying my taxes religiously, I'd like to receive a letter from the IRS saying...

293
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:11,000
Honestly, if I spend my life paying my taxes religiously, I'd like to receive a letter from the IRS saying...

294
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,119
No, nothing, nothing.

295
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,640
You want me to come with you?

296
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
That's good.

297
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
What are you doing?

298
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,239
Hangover?

299
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:05,280
Listen, yesterday was already... it was bad.

300
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,320
But, well, I won't fool you, I know what I'm doing.

301
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,879
It's okay, Oti.

302
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,200
- Sure, I like you very much.

303
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,720
In addition, we all have our desires.

304
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,280
I want us to be friends.

305
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,119
In the end what?

306
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,360
Do we have the ass we deserve or not?

307
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,640
Hey, we're here to pay for the card.

308
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,600
Oh, girl, is that, on Mandri Street, what did you expect?

309
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,560
Go to Ronda Mitre, by the way.

310
00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:45,280
- Not so much laugh, Ester, I'm not stupid.

311
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:46,640
Susana, don't be angry.

312
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,760
How about the exhibition? Are you going to buy something?

313
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:55,280
Oh, buy a painting, your walls are so boring.

314
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:57,840
Sure, buy pictures, instead of stealing them.

315
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,600
Don't start, do me a favor.

316
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,000
If you come to say nonsense, you better get out.

317
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,520
Mom, I told you he'd come.

318
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,800
Fuck, Ester, what about this coat?

319
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,520
Do you like it?

320
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:15,680
Minerva Picotti, my mother, my aunt Ester and her friends.

321
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,640
Minerva Picotti, my mother, my aunt Ester and her friends.

322
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,320
What was your name again?

323
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:22,439
Rai, how ugly!

324
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
That's nice!

325
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,959
Esther, please!

326
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,920
Well, we're over here.

327
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,959
In Argentina they're terrible, aren't they?

328
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:45,040
- Shut up, he'll hear you.

329
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,160
My mother doesn't know me.

330
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,600
When I was little, I never gave myself what I wanted.

331
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,800
If I asked for a toy car, she sent someone to buy me a big motor car, you know?

332
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:09,400
If I asked for a toy car, she sent someone to buy me a big motor car, you know?

333
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,160
Sometimes I miss reading a book.

334
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,840
In the "insti" I read "The story of a castaway".

335
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,280
It's short, but it's okay, huh?

336
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,239
Today, in class, the Weierstrass theorem was explained to us.

337
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,760
Today, in class, the Weierstrass theorem was explained to us.

338
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
Here?

339
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
According to the theorem, if a function ephe...

340
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,680
According to the theorem, if a function ephe...

341
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,959
Of equis...

342
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,280
It's continuous in an interval...

343
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,600
a, b, then, efe...

344
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
a, b, then, efe...

345
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:15,879
It's narrowed down in this interval.

346
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,760
It's narrowed down in this interval.

347
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,640
"Filled down" means that it is limited by two numbers: above...

348
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
"Filled down" means that it is limited by two numbers: above...

349
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,720
And down there.

350
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:40,760
That I don't want to be sold, I want it for myself.

351
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,920
What's wrong with you?

352
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,840
Okay, no, Minerva, I didn't mean that.

353
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,479
I've been offered a job in a high school.

354
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,200
The next course.

355
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,560
He'd charge twice as much.

356
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:49,879
I'm not so clear.

357
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,000
I don't know, the truth is I feel good here, I feel motivated.

358
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,920
And more now, that first-timers are better than last year's.

359
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,959
And so much! Today in class a superchulo debate has been organized, they have not stopped intervening.

360
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,320
And so much! Today in class a superchulo debate has been organized, they have not stopped intervening.

361
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:03,920
And so much! Today in class a superchulo debate has been organized, they have not stopped intervening.

362
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,040
I'm not kidding.

363
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,879
I have a feeling they like me.

364
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,160
That's why I hesitate to leave.

365
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,400
Here I have students...

366
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,720
especially interesting.

367
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,720
It's cool in the fall, isn't it?

368
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,479
It's dark before.

369
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,760
Okay. Was that it?

370
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,800
Shall we take a break? I have a croissant.

371
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,119
If you give me half.

372
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,239
Leave it.

373
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,600
No, well, yeah, I'll let you bite it.

374
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,479
You're funny enough, man, huh?

375
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,040
Why? I look smaller, don't I?

376
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:19,959
Have you fallen in love or what?

377
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,080
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

378
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,640
You can't fall in love so fast.

379
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,320
I'm in love with Minerva.

380
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,000
But she prefers art rather than croissants.

381
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,800
Did you say something?

382
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:28,239
How's it going?

383
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,600
You were right.

384
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:34,600
What the ball did to me the other day in class didn't bother me at all.

385
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
What the ball did to me the other day in class didn't bother me at all.

386
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,640
I felt humiliated.

387
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,040
I recognize that...

388
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,560
I don't like to lose.

389
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,040
And what pisses me off is that I'm known to be lost.

390
00:39:03,305 --> 00:40:03,517
