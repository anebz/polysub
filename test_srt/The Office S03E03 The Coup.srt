1
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,271
I'm hungry.

2
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,043
Mooovie Monday!

3
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:15,714
The only cure I know
for the Monday blues is...

4
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:18,350
Varsity Blues.

5
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,852
Let's go!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

6
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:21,720
Take a seat down there.
Second from the end.

7
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,622
All right, everybody here?

8
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:24,623
Yes.

9
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,125
Popcorn, anyone?

10
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:27,793
Yes, please!

11
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,294
Thank you.

12
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:32,398
Anyone else?

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,533
No.

14
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,802
Movie Monday started
with training videos.

15
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,737
But we went through those
pretty fast.

16
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:42,474
Then we watched a medical video.

17
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:44,076
Since then, it's been
half hour installments

18
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:46,578
of various movies.

19
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,014
With the exception of
an episode of Entourage,

20
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,749
which Michael made us watch
six times.

21
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:54,319
Entourage!

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,074

23
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,321
Kevin, would you like to do
the scenes from last week?

24
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,656
Yes.

25
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:31,824
Why him?

26
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:33,725
Don't whine.
Get the windows.

27
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,428
Previously on Varsity Blues...

28
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,331
Okay, Billy Bob
got a head injury,

29
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,033
but coach made him play.

30
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:43,902
So then Lance, he gets sacked.

31
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,337
And he's out for the year.

32
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,645
Hello?

33
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,715
Not everyone approves
of movie Monday.

34
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,250
I won't say who.

35
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:01,086
I don't approve.
I don't.

36
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,755
Hello?

37
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,796
Let's go after that title now.

38
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:14,166
Let's go, let's go!
Let's go!

39
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,170
Hi, Jan!

40
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:19,605
Hope you brought the Milk Duds.

41
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,240
How would a movie

42
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:22,841
increase productivity, Michael?

43
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:25,777
How, on earth, would it do that?

44
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,546
People work faster after.

45
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:28,614
Magically.

46
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:30,249
No.

47
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,951
They have to,
to make up for the time...

48
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:33,952
watching the movie.

49
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,454
No.

50
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:37,189
Do I need to hire
a babysitter for you...

51
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:38,557
Kitchen.

52
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,691
Some little 14-year-old girl

53
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,360
whose job it is...

54
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,228
Michael is going to
get us all fired.

55
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,130
You sat back and let him
play that dumb movie

56
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,365
and now Jan is peeved off.

57
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,966
And we're all
going to lose our jobs.

58
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,635
That's not going to happen.

59
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,770
You know she has it
out for him now.

60
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,105
That's not his fault.

61
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,473
He had to follow his heart.

62
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,842
Ever since Michael
dumped Jan for Carol,

63
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,810
Jan's been bitching out on him.

64
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,680
Reject a woman and she will
never let it go.

65
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,882
One of the many defects
of their kind.

66
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:05,250
Also, weak arms.

67
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:09,054
Dwight, you should be
running this office.

68
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,459
Michael would never let me.

69
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,794
It's not up to Michael.

70
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,129
It's Jan's call.
Talk to her.

71
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:18,463
I could never do that.

72
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,698
Fine, sit back and do nothing

73
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,700
and let us all get fired.

74
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,074
I know that patience
and loyalty are good

75
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,709
and virtuous traits.

76
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,946
But sometimes I just think
you need to grow a pair.

77
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:36,815
At the Stanford branch,
they all play

78
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,785
this World War II video game
called Call of Duty.

79
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:42,287
And they're all really into it.

80
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,157
I'm told it started
as a team building exercise.

81
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,226
Unfortunately,
I really suck at it.

82
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,760
Oh.

83
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,630
We didn't play
many video games in Scranton.

84
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,966
Instead we'd do stuff like...

85
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,635
Uh, Pam and I would sometimes
hum the same

86
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,003
high pitched note.

87
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,771
And try to get Dwight
to make an appointment

88
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,341
with an ear doctor.

89
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:05,744
And Pam called it...

90
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,512
Pretendonitis.

91
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,881
Hey, Kelly,
my stuff just got here.

92
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,620
Kelly really likes
to online shop.

93
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:18,490
So I felt like I wanted
some new clothes.

94
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,692
I mean, I just...

95
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,694
I wanted to...

96
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:27,065
I felt like it was time
to maybe, um...

97
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,600
just get new clothes.

98
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,803
Okay.

99
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,572
I love it.

100
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,173
Really?
I don't know.

101
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,642
Now, you haven't even
tried it on yet.

102
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:37,943
Try it on.

103
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,244
Not at work.
I'll try it on...

104
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,879
Fashion show!
Fashion show!

105
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,347
Fashion show at lunch!

106
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,450
No.

107
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,752
Fashion show!
Fashion show!

108
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,820
Fashion show at lunch!

109
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,155
Fashion show!
Fashion show!

110
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,590
Fashion show at lunch!

111
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,894
Why did you do that?

112
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,330
I'm just killing Germans
any way I can.

113
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:00,732
We're on the German team.

114
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:04,670
Shoot the British.

115
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:06,238
Wait, are we playing teams?

116
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,307
Yeah.

117
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,642
Wah!

118
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,111
Gah!

119
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,655
Hello?

120
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,257
Is this Jan?

121
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,258
Who is this?

122
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,428
This is Dwight Schrute.

123
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,763
I am calling about
an extremely sensitive matter.

124
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,765
You should talk to Michael
and he'll talk to me

125
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,134
and that way we don't have
to speak to each other.

126
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,669
It's about Michael.

127
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,205
What about him?

128
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,342
I can't talk here.
It's too sensitive.

129
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,677
It's not about
a surprise party, is it?

130
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,746
No, but we should discuss that
another time.

131
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,415
Look, I'm already an hour
outside of Scranton, Dwight.

132
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,050
I am not coming back.

133
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,052
Pull over at exit 40.

134
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:58,023
There is a Liz Claiborne outlet.

135
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,825
I know you like that store.

136
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:03,095
Go inside and shop
until I can meet you.

137
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:05,097
How do you know
I like that store?

138
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,832
Many of your blouses
are Claibornes.

139
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,400
How do you know that?

140
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,135
It's part of my job.

141
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:13,372
No, it's not.
It's officially not.

142
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,073
Noted.

143
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,610
I'm going to the dentist.

144
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,380
Okay.

145
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:23,281
I have to have
an emergency crown put in.

146
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,716
Ouchy.

147
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,985
Yes.

148
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,222
It's a new dentist.
He's far.

149
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:34,159
I might be gone three hours.

150
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,327
Three hours, wow.

151
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,062
Have fun.

152
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,403
Did you get anything good?

153
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,104
Yeah.

154
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,473
New blouse?

155
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:53,011
Halter top?
Camisole?

156
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,212
Teddy?

157
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,347
I could save the branch.

158
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,415
Really.

159
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,017
If you let me run it.

160
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,218
Okay.

161
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,420
Okay, I can run it?

162
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:04,990
What would you do differently?

163
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,324
Mostly get rid of waste.

164
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,994
Which is half the people there.

165
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:11,062
And clean house.

166
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,498
Right here.
It's all for me.

167
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,900
Thank you.

168
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:17,302
Dwight, you just feel strongly
to speak with me this way

169
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,870
behind Michael's back.

170
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,972
And turn on so many
of your co-workers.

171
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,843
The decision to turn on Michael
was difficult.

172
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:27,412
But once I did it,
I didn't look back.

173
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:30,015
And mostly I feel that
Michael would approve.

174
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:35,053
It's really what's best
for the branch.

175
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,489
And I could care less
about my co-workers.

176
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:40,992
So, here we are.

177
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:44,596
It's all on the table.

178
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,499
I want the branch.

179
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:52,270
And I await your decision.

180
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,976
Oh, by the way...

181
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,812
There's a new Ann Taylor
outlet store near here.

182
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,114
I know you like their earrings.

183
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,452
Where is it?

184
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:08,854
Michael.
Hi.

185
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,622
I've had a very interesting
conversation

186
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:11,756
with one of your employees.

187
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:12,891
Oh, that's nice.

188
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,226
No, it wasn't.

189
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:15,660
Dwight just told me
that he thinks

190
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,696
he can run the branch
better than you.

191
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:20,031
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,333
You were at the dentist?

193
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,701
You can't have people
undermining you.

194
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:23,902
Get control of your branch
immediately.

195
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:24,903
Okay.

196
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,137
What was Dwight thinking?

197
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,373
That he could turn Jan
against me?

198
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,042
She's my ex-lover... ish.

199
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:35,747
Wow.

200
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:36,915
It's so sexy.

201
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:37,983
You look so hot.

202
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,818
It's really something.

203
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,952
It's too much.

204
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,454
- What?
- I'm gonna return it.

205
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,089
No, you have to keep it today.

206
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,424
Just see how you feel.

207
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,792
Hey.

208
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:48,860
Hi.

209
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,695
You look nice.

210
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,298
Thanks.

211
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,500
Isn't that, like,
your third soda today?

212
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,939
Yeah, I think we can be
a big help to your company.

213
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:04,776
Okay, see you next week.
Bye.

214
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,878
Again?

215
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,979
Scared?

216
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,548
Call of Duty!

217
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,386
Andy, Jim, can I see you
in the conference room

218
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,054
- for a minute?
- Now?

219
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,055
Yes, now.

220
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,056
Put the game on hold, everyone.

221
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,457
This is not working, okay?

222
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,959
We are getting slaughtered
out there.

223
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,128
It's the new guy.

224
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,429
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know...

225
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:25,430
what we're talking about.

226
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,665
See what I mean?

227
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,866
We just need a strategy, okay?

228
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:30,035
We're gonna set up a trap
in the gun room.

229
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,836
All right, Jim,
are you using the MP-40

230
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,271
or the 44?

231
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,339
Um, sniper rifle?

232
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,807
Snipe...
What?

233
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,609
Are you playing for
the other team?

234
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,544
You don't snipe
in Carrington, okay?

235
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,379
Saboteur!

236
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,514
Saboteur!

237
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:45,550
I'm gonna kill you for real.

238
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,885
The game is over.

239
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,920
I'm really going to shoot you.

240
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,300
Hey, Dwight...
Hey.

241
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,668
You want an m&m?

242
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,971
No, thanks, I'm stuffed.
No, seriously.

243
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:08,707
You should have an m&m.
They're really good.

244
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,078
Okay.

245
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,453
Good, huh?

246
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,056
So good.

247
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,963
Hey, I thought you weren't
supposed to eat anything

248
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,932
for a couple of hours
after you've had

249
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,667
a crown put in.

250
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,440
They have this new kind of
quick drying bonding.

251
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,541
So...

252
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:44,676
Sounds like a good dentist.

253
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,044
Oh, yeah.

254
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:48,847
What's his name?

255
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,287
Crentist.

256
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,392
Your dentist's name is Crentist.

257
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,596
Huh.

258
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,297
Sounds a lot like dentist.

259
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,902
Maybe that's why
he became a dentist.

260
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,373
Let me see your teeth.

261
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,076
Let me see 'em.

262
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,146
Let me see 'em.

263
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,651
Ohh.

264
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,824
You should floss.

265
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:36,327
I know.

266
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,230
Well then.

267
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:47,806
I'm glad you're okay.

268
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,708
Business is like a jungle.

269
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,144
And I am like a tiger.

270
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:57,048
And Dwight is like a monkey...

271
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,885
that stabs a tiger
in the back with a stick.

272
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,822
Does the tiger fire the monkey?

273
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:06,825
Does the tiger
transfer the monkey

274
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:09,728
to another branch?

275
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,931
Pun.

276
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,967
There is no way
of knowing what goes on

277
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,737
inside the tiger's head.

278
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:19,904
We don't have the technology.

279
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,277
Dwight, can I talk to you
for a second?

280
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,587
Wow, this is tough!

281
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,955
Brrrrr!

282
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,490
What?

283
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:41,659
Oh.

284
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,361
Aaaarg!

285
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,596
What is it?

286
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:48,533
Well...

287
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,735
I just got off the phone
with Jan.

288
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,471
And, um...

289
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,309
She demoted me.

290
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,578
No.

291
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,780
Yeah.

292
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,581
You know what the craziest
part of this is?

293
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,216
She demoted me to your job.

294
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,487
And she said that you
should be expecting

295
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:10,655
a call later from corporate.

296
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,791
And that, um...

297
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,693
I guess that means
that you are going to be

298
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,562
acting manager
of Dunder-Mifflin Scranton.

299
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,631
I can't believe this news.

300
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,600
That... wow.

301
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,236
Yeah.

302
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,605
I told her I didn't know
whether you'd wanna do it.

303
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,974
Because you've always been
so loyal to me.

304
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:33,144
You've been my most
trusted ally.

305
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,414
You said that?

306
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,150
Yep, I did.

307
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,686
I did.

308
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,224
But I think...

309
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,860
you should do it.

310
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:52,530
Well...

311
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:55,200
Gosh, if you think I should.

312
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,701
Then I will.

313
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,374
Perfect.
Well, we're settled.

314
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,443
All right.
All right.

315
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,579
Well, then you are now
acting manager

316
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,948
of Dunder-Mifflin
Scranton branch.

317
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,884
And I am assistant
regional manager.

318
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,152
Assistant to
the regional manager.

319
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,054
Thank you, Michael,
for staying on.

320
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,088
I really appreciate it.

321
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,591
Hey, hey.

322
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:22,060
I can't imagine this place
without you.

323
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:25,263
Can you?

324
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:28,266
That's so nice.

325
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,037
Well, um...

326
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,672
I guess we should
go tell the troops.

327
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:38,610
Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike.

328
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,511
Okay, let's do it.

329
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,251
Hey. Hi, hello.

330
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,620
Everybody, I have
some good news.

331
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:50,455
And I have some bad news.

332
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:55,326
I am being replaced
as your leader by Dwight.

333
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,961
You're kidding.

334
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:58,563
You might think
that I am kidding

335
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,331
and I understand that.

336
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,466
Congratulations, Dwight.

337
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,534
Thank you, Angela.

338
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:04,969
But why Dwight?

339
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:09,707
Because Dwight never lies.

340
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,175
How does that qualify him
to run a branch?

341
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,810
Because that's all it takes.

342
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,013
Okay, Dwight, would you like to

343
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:18,349
say a few words
to everybody about loyalty?

344
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,184
Thank you, Michael.

345
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,453
I just wanna say
to the few of you

346
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,855
who will remain under my employ,

347
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:27,125
that I intend to lead you
into the black

348
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,060
with ferocity.

349
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,929
Michael, what will you do?

350
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:31,963
Oh, I'll be fine.

351
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,531
Do you have any savings?

352
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,966
No, no, I don't.

353
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,367
Michael, you might
lose your condo.

354
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,468
I won't.

355
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,503
I won't.

356
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,672
I have this
little vacuum cleaner

357
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:41,839
that's broken.

358
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:42,840
If Dwight doesn't work out,

359
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,409
maybe that could be manager.

360
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,077
Maybe I'll quit.

361
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,779
It's really happening.

362
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,514
Yes.

363
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,385
We can make a difference here.

364
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:58,656
I will make a difference here.

365
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,124
You alone?

366
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,459
'Cause I thought together...

367
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,127
Oh, please, don't be naive.

368
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:08,466
You can be in charge
of the women.

369
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,009
Look how cute he is.

370
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,278
And he's trying to shoot
with a smoke grenade.

371
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,213
I'm sorry, what are you
whispering back there?

372
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,215
Nothing, just concentrate
on turning around.

373
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,350
I'm trying.

374
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:26,517
I just...

375
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,685
Just tap S then D.

376
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,287
Oh.

377
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,889
Any last words? No?
What?

378
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,928
Wow.

379
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:42,033
Psychopath.

380
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,506
What?

381
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,675
I'm just looking.

382
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,111
Please go back to your desk.

383
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,179
In a minute.

384
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,752
Well, I remember why I dress
the way I do at work.

385
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,787
But I'm gonna keep the clothes.

386
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,122
I mean, it'll just be cool

387
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:07,558
to have some after work clothes
other than pajamas.

388
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:17,068
Well, I guess it's time...

389
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,704
that I turn over the keys

390
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,506
to the famous Sebring.

391
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,141
No, thank you.

392
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,442
It's a corporate lease, Dwight.

393
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,576
You've earned it.

394
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,145
No, thanks.
What?

395
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:29,313
Not my style.

396
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,717
But you said you liked it.

397
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,819
You've always admired it.

398
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,087
That was before.

399
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,355
I'm thinking about
getting something German.

400
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,456
Something with
decent gas mileage.

401
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,224
Plus the convertible

402
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,761
is a ridiculous choice
for this climate.

403
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,229
Take it back.

404
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,732
No.

405
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,137
That's my car.

406
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:57,809
What did you...
That's my car!

407
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,677
Yes.

408
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,746
I know, Dwight.
I know.

409
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,548
I know. I know.

410
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,849
You know what?

411
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:07,085
Jan called me
about your little meeting!

412
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,719
No.

413
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:11,556
I know what you did.

414
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,624
I made the whole thing up,
Dwight.

415
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,059
The Sebring's cool.
Oh, do you?

416
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,160
Do you like the Sebring?

417
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:17,595
How dare you!

418
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,430
How dare you, Dwight?

419
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,066
Don't fire me.
Please.

420
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,068
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't fire you

421
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,169
right here on the spot.

422
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,537
I have excellent sales numbers!

423
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,172
Not good enough!

424
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,240
I'll do anything!

425
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,842
Anything!

426
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,810
I'll do your laundry
for a month!

427
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,145
For a year!
Michael!

428
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,947
I have a laundry machine.

429
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,850
I'm sorry.
I'll do anything.

430
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,585
Please.

431
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,587
Please.

432
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,689
I don't know if I can
trust you anymore.

433
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:45,957
You can't.
You can't.

434
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,658
But I promise I'll never
betray you again.

435
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,660
What can I do, Michael?

436
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,829
What can I do?

437
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,599
What can I do?

438
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,801
What can I do?

439
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,803
What can I do?

440
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,506
You can get up.

441
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,341
Get up.

442
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,849
And you can hug it out, bitch.

443
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,560
Hug it out, bitch.

444
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,328
That is what men
say to each other

445
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,429
after a fight.

446
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:26,531
They hug it out.

447
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,032
And in doing so,

448
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,635
they just let it go.

449
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,503
And walk away.

450
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,972
Then they're done.

451
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,575
Not a good idea to say that
to a woman, however...

452
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,911
I have found.

453
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,813
Doesn't translate.

454
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:16,280
Yeah. Yeah. We hugged it out.

455
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:19,951
But it turns out,
I was still a little angry.

456
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:24,855
So I felt I needed to punish him
just a little bit more.

457
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,924
And I'm making him
do my laundry for a year.

457
00:20:27,305 --> 00:21:27,796
